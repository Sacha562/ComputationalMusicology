# Computational Musicology corpus outline

I'll try to find out the definition of the 'average' pop song in the past 15 years.

For my research, I'll use Spotify's global _top hits_ playlists of the years 2006, 2011, 2016 and 2021. Using 5-year intervals, the differences will probably be clearer and it will be more exciting to compare the statistics to each other. Having aquired this data, it will become clear how pop music has changed over the years.

And because actually _experiencing_ data is way more interesting than just reading a graph of averages, for each year I'll pick the song that is closest to the average of that year. That way, it will become even clearer how the definition of a pop song has shifted with time. It might also be interesting to see what the outliers are in each playlist: were there hits in 2006 that were way ahead of their time? And what are popular songs nowadays that would perfectly fit in a '00s _top hits_ playlist?
